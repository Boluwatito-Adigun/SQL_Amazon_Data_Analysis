# Introduction
In today’s highly competitive e-commerce landscape, data-driven insights are essential for making informed business decisions. This project focuses on analyzing a pseudo Amazon-style transactional database designed to mirror the complexities of a real-world online marketplace. 

Through a series of simple, intermediate, and advanced SQL queries, the analysis aims to answer critical business questions that support strategic decision-making across multiple departments — including sales, inventory management, logistics, customer operations, and finance.

The goal of this analysis is to extract actionable insights that can help leadership optimize product performance, enhance customer experience, streamline operational efficiency, and ultimately maximize revenue. 

By breaking down the data into key segments such as product performance, customer behavior, shipping efficiency, and inventory health, the report provides a comprehensive understanding of the business’s current state and future opportunities.

# Background

The dataset used in this project is a simulated Amazon marketplace database, intentionally structured to reflect real e-commerce operations. Although the data is fictional, the schema, relationships, and business processes closely resemble those found in actual online retail environments. This makes the dataset highly suitable for practicing professional-level data analytics, SQL querying, and strategic business interpretation.

## Key Features of the Dataset

- **Products & Categories:** Includes product IDs, names, prices, costs, and category classifications.

- **Customers:** Contains customer demographics, registration dates, and purchasing behavior patterns.

- **Orders & Order Items:** Tracks quantities, order dates, shipping dates, payment status, and delivery information.

- **Inventory:** Holds stock levels, warehouse details, and restock history.

- **Sellers:** Features seller profiles, sales activity, and fulfillment success rates.

- **Shipping Providers:** Includes delivery partners, number of orders handled, and delivery performance metrics.

- **Returns & Cancellations:** Documents product returns, reasons, and return rate patterns.

The dataset is relational and normalized to represent how transactions flow across different business functions. This allows for meaningful end-to-end analysis — from the moment a customer registers, to placing an order, to fulfillment, delivery, and post-purchase behavior such as returns.

### Purpose of the Analysis

Using this dataset, the analysis addresses a wide range of 20+ business-critical questions designed to reveal insights such as:

- Which products and categories generate the most revenue?

- How effectively is the company retaining and monetizing customers?

- What inventory risks exist due to low stock or declining categories?

- How well are delivery providers performing?

- Which sellers and customers drive the most value?

- Where do operational inefficiencies such as shipping delays or pending shipments occur?

The queries applied range from basic aggregations to advanced analytical functions, window functions, ranking, date manipulation, and subqueries. This mirrors the type of SQL analysis expected in real e-commerce analytics roles.
